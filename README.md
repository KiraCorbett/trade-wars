A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance. He's a bit of a flirt, but I'm 'a give it a chance
I asked about his fam'ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants
Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place then I turn and see my sister's face and she is
"Helpless..."
And I know she is
"Helpless..."
And her eyes are just
"Helpless..."
And I realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time
"Where are you taking me?"
"I'm about to change your life."
"Then by all means, lead the way."
Number one!
I'm a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in New York City
Is insidious, and Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less
"Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you."
"Schuyler?"
"My sister."
Number two!
He's after me cuz I'm a Schuyler sister. That elevates his status
I'd have to be na√Øve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza, now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied
"Thank you for all your service."
"If it takes fighting a war for us to meet
it will have been worth it."
"I'll leave you to it."
Number three!
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine"
She'd be lying
But when I fantasize at night it's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might have been if I hadn't sized him up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife
At least I keep his eyes in my life
To the Groom!
(To the groom! To the groom! To the groom!)
To the Bride!
(To the bride! To the bride! To the bride!)
From your sister
Angelica! Angelica! Angelica!
Who is always by your side!
(By your side! by your side!)
To your union!
(To the union! To the revolution!)
And the hope that you provide!
(Provide, to provide)
May you always
(Always.)
Be Satisfied
(be satisfied, be satisfied. be satisfied)
And I know
She'll be happy as his bride
And I know
He will never be satisfied
